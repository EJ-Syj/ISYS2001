This project collates many of the exercises from this weekâ€™s activities. This is intentionalâ€”by combining these exercises, you can reflect on your progress and see how well youâ€™re following the industry best practices we espouse. These practices include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Meaningful Notebook Naming:** Give your notebook a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `finance_tracker_profile_setup.ipynb`).\n",
        "- **Frequent Saves & Version Control:** Save your work often and use descriptive commit messages when uploading to GitHub.\n",
        "- **Descriptive Variable Names:** Use names like `user_name`, `theme_color`, etc., to clearly convey their purpose.\n",
        "- **Code Comments & Documentation:** Use text cells and inline comments to document your thought process.\n",
        "- **Critical Use of AI:** Ask follow-up questions if anything is unclear, and verify that AI suggestions align with the basics youâ€™ve learnt (i.e., using input(), print(), basic data types, and variables).\n",
